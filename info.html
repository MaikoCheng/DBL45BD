      <p>[Verse 1]<br>
        We're no strangers to love<br>
        You know the rules and so do I<br>
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
        Gotta make you understand<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        We've known each other for so long<br>
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br>
        Inside, we both know what's been going on<br>
        We know the game, and we're gonna play it<br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
        Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
        
        [Post-Chorus]<br>
        Ooh (Give you up)<br>
        Ooh-ooh (Give you up)<br>
        Ooh-ooh<br>
        Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)<br>
        Ooh-ooh<br>
        Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)<br>
        [Bridge]<br>
        We've known each other for so long<br>
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br>
        Inside, we both know what's been going on<br>
        We know the game, and we're gonna play it<br>
        <br>
        [Pre-Chorus]<br>
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
        Gotta make you understand<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
        Never gonna give you up<br>
        Never gonna let you down<br>
        Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
        Never gonna make you cry<br>
        Never gonna say goodbye<br>
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p><br>
